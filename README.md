# Chatbot_ALISHA

This chatbot was from about a year and a half ago when I was taking a Comp Org and Assembly Language class.
It wasn't for an actual assignment for the class, just a side project. I had to keep it simple due to the complexity
of assembly language. My Chatbot OPHELIA written in Python is much better, but I'm still happy that I was aable to pull this one off.

Just to note, this folder was pulled straight from Visual Studio, and the project folder was already set up in a way to
deal with assembly programs, so it might take some modifications to get it working just with the .asm file.

For further instructions on running the program, see the main .asm file comments in the project folder for details.
